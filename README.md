# XP-Tracker

In the book [The C# Player's Guide](URL 'https://csharpplayersguide.com/') there is a [XP Tracker](URL 'https://csharpplayersguide.com/assets/content/downloadables/XPTracker.pdf') provided to help you track your progress. This works great, but I wanted to see if I could create a program that allows you to check off your progress, calculate the xp earned, and display the accumulated xp.

This is a work in progress.

TODO:
- Finish out the Part 1 section. _(Checkboxes, Progress on the xp grid, save & load form with user selected data, calcualte XP gained.)_ **In Progress**
- ~~Come up with a way to save so when you open the application again your progress isn't lost.~~ Implemented solution 2/22/2022
